              <h1> Welcome to AURIO </h1>
              <p> We are the world's leading manufacturer of the simplistic Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), AURIO&trade;. The AURIO&trade; workstation is like no other DAW available on the market. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="phase-one animate-bottom" id="phase-one">
              <h1>Project Phase 1 </h1>

              <h2>Introduction + Mandate</h2>
              <p>The purpose of AURIO&trade; is to create a simplified DAW that gives the user control of their desired experience. The goal is to provide users of DAWs (from beginner level up to advanced) with a "less cluttered" experience while using audio editing software. Current software on the market requires a lot of learning before being able to use extensively.</p>


              <h3>Project Definition</h3>
              <p>Team JAGER will conduct extensive research on user interaction with Digital Audio Workstations, to create the best user experience. We will be completing 4 milestones over the length of the term. Our team will be required to design, implement, and evaluate a prototype user interface for our proposed project, AURIO&trade;.</p>

              <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
              <p>Our goal is to provide users with an empowering experience. We started with a basic DAW that is simplistic in design, with an easy to use, easy to learn interface. To build upon this, creators will be able to easily download desired plug-ins to enhance their experience. Simply browse through a library of provided and user created plug-ins, install the ones you need, and immediately get back to working on your creation! By eliminating the hassle of hiding undesired features, creators will have a clean screen to focus on their content, not their workstation.</p>
              <p>The problem with current DAWs is that they are unnecessarily complex for the majority of users. AURIOTM provides users with only the features they need. No more scouring through countless menus, help sites, and forums.</p>

              <h3>Motivational Scenario</h3>
              <p>Reginald, a.k.a Mixmaster Reggie-Nald, is an up and coming electronic music producer in Victoria looking to drop 2019’s hottest new mixtape. Unfortunately, Reginald has never used any audio-editing software before in his life. He buys a variety of DAW software, looking to mix some of his favourite tracks with his own collection of sound recordings. As soon as he opens up his new DAW however, he is bombarded by a jungle of menus, buttons, and sliders, none of which he knows a thing about. After an hour of trying to figure the software out, with many trips to its meager “Help” menu, Reginald starts to feel the frustration set in. “Why does every DAW I try look like it’s designed for a nuclear physicist?” he asks himself in exasperation. “Why can’t there be a DAW that regular people can understand from the get-go?”</p>

    
              <h3>Usability Goals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Effectiveness:</b> At its core, AURIO should be a functional, well-oiled DAW. Simplicity and ease of use mean nothing if the underlying software doesn’t work like it should.</li>
                <li><b>Learnability:</b> Many DAW’s are notorious for their steep learning curve; AURIO should be the solution. We want AURIO to be user friendly and intuitive, even for someone totally unfamiliar with the idea of a DAW.</li>
                <li><b>Utility: </b>AURIO prioritizes being beginner-friendly, but this should never be conflated with being “dumbed down”. AURIO should provide advanced functionality to those who seek it, supplementing with plugins when needed.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>User Experience Goals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Enjoyment: </b>AURIO shouldn’t just be a DAW, it should be an experience. Editing audio should be a seamless session of creativity, where your DAW is helping you instead of standing in your way; AURIO should reflect this notion.</li>
                <li><b>Aesthetically pleasing: </b>It goes without saying that AURIO should be aesthetically pleasing software. To quote The Zen of Python, “Beautiful is better than ugly. Simple is better than complex. Readability counts.”</li>
                <li><b>Inspires creativity: </b>Buried under the goals of user-friendliness and simplicity lies one simple idea: creativity. AURIO should inspire users to think more creatively about their audio editing and music production, instead of thinking about how to navigate a complicated UI.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>
              <p>With AURIO&trade;, we aim to cater to a number of various user groups. Whether or not you are a total beginner to music, have played an instrument for a couple of years, or are a professional producer, AURIO&trade; is designed to accommodate your individual needs.</p>
              <p>Key stakeholders of the AURIO&trade; audio workstation include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>users who are not familiar with DAWs and are looking to get started</li>
                <li>users who are comfortable with another DAW (or DAWs) and are looking to switch to AURIO&trade;</li>
                <li>users who just want to "mess around"</li>
                <li>users who are looking to use AURIO&trade; to produce professional/commercial tracks</li>
                <li>users who are newcomers to music (ie. do not know music theory and do not play any instruments)</li>
                <li>users who have studied music academically or who are already familiar with one or more musical instruments</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Assumptions</h3>
              <p>At Project JAGER, we don't like to make assumptions. However, some are unavoidable in order to make each user's experience a good one.</p>
              <p>We assume that our users are interested in music and learning a bit about music theory and music production. Although it is our core belief that AURIO&trade; is easy for beginners to use, there will always be a slight learning curve when beginning to produce music.<p>
              <p>We also assume that our core users are comfortable using technology. What we mean by this is users are able to, for example, open and close desktop applications, and are generally able to move around a new application with ease. We hope that this does not discourage users who may not be comfortable with software; we make this assumption because Digital Audio Workstations are exactly that -- digital, and as such they require a base level of technological maneuvering.</p>

              <h3>User Profiles</h3>
              <p>A few main user profiles for AURIO&trade; are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>audio editors</li>
                  <li>complete beginners</li>
                  <li>intermediate musicians</li>
                  <li>advanced producers</li>
                </ul>

              <h4>Audio Editors</h4>
              <p>Audio editors are those who require a very simple audio editing program to split or loop music clips. An example of a member of this group is a YouTuber who is looking to simply cut a certain part of a song for their intro music. Another example would be a dancer who is looking to merge two songs together so that one fades into the next so they can choreograph a piece. Audio editors are not looking to get into the more complex or powerful features of music production, and are not looking to create their own music. They simply need an intuitive interface to edit existing music clips.</p> 
  
              <h4>Complete Beginners</h4>
              <p>Complete beginners are those who have little experience with music theory or who do not play any instruments. These are users who haven't played or made music since grade 6 band, but are looking to reignite their passion and get into music production. These users are unfamiliar with technical, but are ready to learn in order to create their own music.</p>
  

              <h4>Intermediate Muscicians</h4>
              <p>Intermediate musicians are those who play one or more instruments or have training in music theory. They are new to music production but understand many of the underlying concepts, such as reverb, delay, tempo, key, panning, and other filters. They may already have an idea of what kind of song they would like to produce, but do not yet know how to go about doing so in a DAW.<p>

              <h4>Advanced Producers</h4>
              <p>Advanced producers are professional or hobbiest producers who are very familiar with one or more DAWs. Perhaps they already produce using Ableton, Logic, or FL Studio, but are looking to try out something new. They already know which parts of a DAW they use the most, how they like their workflow to be, and have a very concrete understanding of what a DAW needs to provide in order to satisfy their user needs.<p>

              <h2>Scenarios</h2>
              
              <h3>Audrey and Jacob</h3>
              <p>This scenario walks through:<p>
              <ul>
                <li>splitting and joining clips</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Jacob and Audrey are talented circus performers preparing an act for an upcoming show. Their act consists of three separate parts: an upbeat beginning, a slow middle, and a marvelous finale. They already have their music picked out and just need a simple editor to splice together the clips and have them fade from one to the next. Neither are trained in music, nor do they have any interest to be. They also are not very comfortable using complex technology, but they know how to open and close a program on their computer. Upon Googling for the simplest audio editor, they come across AURIO and like it’s simplistic design. They download AURIO, open it up, and select “Audio Editor” as their start configuration. Seeing that there is the option to go through a beginner tutorial, they click on it and walk through the brief tutorial on how to add, delete, split, and join tracks, also learning how to adjust the volume of each track. They drag and drop their music into each track, and adjust the volume of each using the volume curve so it sounds like the music fades from one song to the next. Lastly, they export their song to a .mp3 file and are happy with the result.</p>


              <h3>Axl + Rose</h3>
              <p>Axl and Rose are a brother and sister, aged 6 and 8, who want to record themselves singing Happy Birthday for their grandmother, who lives in Lithuania. With their parents’ help, they open up AURIO on their family computer, and plug in a microphone. Neither Rose nor Axl has much experience with DAWs, but thanks to AURIO’s simple and intuitive user interface, they find the record button, and record themselves singing their song without a problem. Afterwards, they realize they were standing a little too far from the microphone, and that the resulting track is much too quiet. To fix this, they increase the track’s volume, and after giving their song another listen, decide they’re happy with the result. They save their composition in an email-friendly format, close up AURIO, and send their song off to Grandma.</p>

              <h3>Reginald</h3>
              <p>Mixmaster Reggie-Nald is back, and this time he’s armed with AURIO. After such a disastrous experience with other DAWs, Reginald is hesitant to dive back into the world of music editing, but decides to give AURIO a swing, at the recommendation of several of his friends. Reginald sits down at his laptop and opens up AURIO, but quickly realizes that he doesn’t have any recording equipment of his own! Thankfully, with AURIO’s extensive built-in library of sounds and instrument samples, Reginald is able to cobble together a rough outline of a song. He continues by experimenting with a number of different filters, all the while adjusting the volume of each track to his liking. Just a few short hours later, Reginald leans back in his chair and revels in his work: an absolute banger of a track (or so he thinks).</p>

              <h3>Elias</h3>
              <p>Elias is the lead singer and producer of Portland-based alternative rock band Profound Cactus. Elias has worked with a wide range of DAW software over his years as his band’s producer, and knows his way around a mixing console. Since switching to AURIO a few months ago, Elias has been quite happy with the results, but for his band’s new upcoming single Space Flower, he just can’t find a filter in AURIO that achieves the sound he’s looking for. Knowing that AURIO is a plugin-based DAW, Elias opens up TWYX, AURIO’s plugin sharing platform to try to find a solution. After a few minutes of searching, Elias finds an “Advanced Filters” plugin that adds dozens of extra filters on top of AURIO’s modest default selection. Adding the plugin, Elias sets off again looking for the perfect sound for Space Flower, armed with a far wider selection of filters to choose from.</p>

              <h3>DJ Slayer</h3>
              <p>DJ Slayer is a prominent figure in the underground metal-electronic music scene. He is praised for his quality of production and the ingenuity of his beats. However, DJ Slayer is looking for a new tool for his arsenal: something quick and intuitive to either prototype new melodies or rhythms, or quickly edit existing software with a variety of imported plugins. Being used to other DAWs, Slayer might yearn for a certain interface when producing music. With a few drags, drops and setting changes he is able to customize AURIO’s layout and now has his loops, plugins and editing windows where he prefers them.</p>

              <h3>Jamie</h3>
              <p>Jamie is a 27-year old ASMR YouTuber, and is planning on creating custom audio for her youtube channel. She is very indecisive. First, Jamie downloads AURIO from the dedicated website, going through a brief installer and setup. She finds a library of loops and settles upon a mainline beat as a softrock drum beat. She adds it to her workspace in a new track. Then she decides she doesn’t like it. She deletes it from the track. Here, her indecisiveness kicks back in and she thinks she wants the track back. She undoes her action and the beat reappears in the track.</p>

              <h2>Hierarchical Task Analysis</h2>

              <h3>Jamie</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Start up AURIO&trade; for the first time.
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>Go through standard install process</li>
                    <li>Select starting user configuration as beginner</li>
                    <li>Option of quick tutorial</li>
                    <li>Select any additional plug-ins (Jamie chooses none)<li>
                    <li>Finish and start up editor</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Find first audio loop (L1)</li>
