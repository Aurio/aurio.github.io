              <h1> Welcome to AURIO </h1>
              <p> We are the world's leading manufacturer of the simplistic Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), AURIO&trade;. The AURIO&trade; workstation is like no other DAW available on the market. </p>
              <p>Carefully designed from start to finish by the industry's finest computer scientists, all of who graduated from the cutting-edge University of Victoria, AURIO&trade; will forever change the way you produce music. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="phase-one animate-bottom" id="phase-one">
              <h1>Project Phase 1 </h1>

              <h2>Introduction + Mandate</h2>
              <p>The purpose of AURIO&trade; is to create a simplified DAW that gives the user control of their desired experience. The goal is to provide users of DAWs (from beginner level up to advanced) with a "less cluttered" experience while using audio editing software. Current software on the market requires a lot of learning before being able to use extensively.</p>
              <p>Our aim is to give users an empowering experience. We started with a basic DAW that has a STUPIDLY EASY to understand interface, then allowed users to download and design their own plug-ins. This allows users to tailor their experience to only the functions the need or want to use.<p>
              <p>Time to complete a task should be low. Time to learn a task should be low.</p>

              <h2>Key Stakeholders</h2>
              <p>With AURIO&trade;, we aim to cater to a number of various user groups. Whether or not you are a total beginner to music, have played an instrument for a couple of years, or are a professional producer, AURIO&trade; is designed to accommodate your individual needs.</p>
              <p>Key stakeholders of the AURIO&trade; audio workstation include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>users who are not familiar with DAWs and are looking to get started</li>
                <li>users who are comfortable with another DAW (or DAWs) and are looking to switch to AURIO&trade;</li>
                <li>users who just want to "mess around"</li>
                <li>users who are looking to use AURIO&trade; to produce professional/commercial tracks</li>
                <li>users who are newcomers to music (ie. do not know music theory and do not play any instruments)</li>
                <li>users who have studied music academically or who are already familiar with one or more musical instruments</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Assumptions</h3>
              <p>At Project JAGER, we don't like to make assumptions. However, some are unavoidable in order to make each user's experience a good one.</p>
              <p>We assume that our users are interested in music and learning a bit about music theory and music production. Although it is our core belief that AURIO&trade; is easy for beginners to use, there will always be a slight learning curve when beginning to produce music.<p>
              <p>We also assume that our core users are comfortable using technology. What we mean by this is users are able to, for example, open and close desktop applications, know which items are likely clickable and which aren't, and are generally able to move around a new application with ease. We hope that this does not discourage users who may not be comfortable with software; we make this assumption because Digital Audio Workstations are exactly that -- digital, and as such they require a base level of technological maneuvering.</p>

              <h3>User Profiles</h3>
              <p>A few main user profiles for AURIO&trade; are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>audio editors</li>
                  <li>complete beginners</li>
                  <li>intermediate musicians</li>
                  <li>advanced producers</li>
                </ul>

              <h4>Audio Editors</h4>
              <p>Audio editors are those who require a very simple audio editing program to split or loop music clips. An example of a member of this group is a YouTuber who is looking to simply cut a certain part of a song for their intro music. Another example would be a dancer who is looking to merge two songs together so that one fades into the next so they can choreograph a piece. Audio editors are not looking to get into the more complex or powerful features of music production, and are not looking to create their own music. They simply need an intuitive interface to edit existing music clips.</p> 
  
              <h4>Complete Beginners</h4>
              <p>Complete beginners are those who have little experience with music theory or who do not play any instruments. These are users who haven't played or made music since grade 6 band, but are looking to reignite their passion and get into music production. These users are unfamiliar with technical, but are ready to learn in order to create their own music.</p>
  

              <h4>Intermediate Muscicians</h4>
              <p>Intermediate musicians are those who play one or more instruments or have training in music theory. They are new to music production but understand many of the underlying concepts, such as reverb, delay, tempo, key, panning, and other filters. They may already have an idea of what kind of song they would like to produce, but do not yet know how to go about doing so in a DAW.<p>

              <h4>Advanced Producers</h4>
              <p>Advanced producers are professional or hobbiest producers who are very familiar with one or more DAWs. Perhaps they already produce using Ableton, Logic, or FL Studio, but are looking to try out something new. They already know which parts of a DAW they use the most, how they like their workflow to be, and have a very concrete understanding of what a DAW needs to provide in order to satisfy their user needs.<p>

              <h2>Scenarios</h2>
              
              <h3>Reginald</h3>
              <p>Reginald, a.k.a Mixmaster Reggie-Nald, is an up and coming electronic music producer in Victoria looking to drop 2019’s hottest new mixtape. Unfortunately, Reginald has never used any audio-editing software before in his life. He buys a variety of DAW software, looking to mix some of his favourite tracks with his own collection of sound recordings. As soon as he opens up his new DAW however, he is bombarded by a jungle of menus, buttons, and sliders, none of which he knows a thing about. After an hour of trying to figure the software out, with many trips to its meager “Help” menu, Reginald starts to feel the frustration set in. “Why does every DAW I try look like it’s designed for a nuclear physicist?” he asks himself in exasperation. “Why can’t there be a DAW that regular people can understand from the get-go?”</p>

              <h3>Axl + Rose</h3>
              <p>Axl and Rose are a brother and sister, aged 6 and 8, who want to record themselves singing Happy Birthday for their grandmother, who lives in Lithuania. With their parents’ help, they open up AURIO on their family computer, and plug in a microphone. Neither Rose nor Axl has much experience with DAW’s, but thanks to AURIO’s simple and intuitive user interface, they find the record button, and record themselves singing their song without a problem. Afterwards, they realize they were standing a little too close to the microphone, and that the resulting track is much too loud. To fix this, they decrease the track’s volume, and after giving their song another listen, decide they’re happy with the result. They save their composition in an email-friendly format, close up AURIO, and send their song off to Grandma.</p>

              <h3>Jamie</h3>
              <p>Jamie is planning on creating custom audio for her youtube channel. She has never used a DAW before but is very comfortable with video editing, the concepts of layered media and the UI of a video editor. First, Jamie downloads AURIO from the dedicated website, going through a brief installer and setup. She finds a library of loops and settles upon a mainline beat as a softrock drum beat. She then wants to add a second track to accompany the mainline. She selects another beat from the library and creates a new track with it, which she wants to be quieter than the mainline beat. Jamie adjusts the volume mixer so that it is 70% as loud as it was initially. Jamie realizes she doesn’t like this loop and wants to delete it. Jamie then chooses a third loop to insert into the beginning and end of the video as an introduction and exit signal. Jamie wants this loop to be similar sounding but also be different for the beginning and end. She finds a loop with a cheerful and energetic start but a relaxed ending. Jamie splits this loop and positions the intro section at the start of the video and the outro at the end of the video. However, Jamie wants a very simple beat so that her viewers are not distracted from her content, and after review she realizes that the second beat is too much and wants to delete it. Jamie deletes the second track and is happy with her finished product. Until Jamie realizes that she actually does want the second track, but forgets exactly what audio loop and settings she had configured. She undoes her action and has everything back to the way it was. Jamie then publishes her creation and imports the file into her video editor.</p>
